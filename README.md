# 👋 Hi, I'm Debby Yeh

🎯 NLP Application Engineer | HR Tech Enthusiast | Open-Source Contributor

Passionate about building ethical AI tools that enhance workplace transparency and empower individuals.

## 💡 Why I Build NLP Systems

I believe language is the core interface between people, systems, and decision-making. Coming from an HR background and transitioning into NLP, I aim to build AI tools that improve workplace transparency, reduce institutional bias, and empower individuals.

My work focuses on combining real-world social insight with applied AI—especially in areas where fairness, communication, and scalable systems intersect.
